=======================
Section 4 11 LS command
=======================

ls - list content

======================
Section 4 12 RD vs APD
======================

RD - Relative Directory
APD - Apsolute Path Directory

cd - change directory

Move to specific directory
	terminal --> cd <destination>

Go to /root/home directory
	terminal --> cd

Got to Linux root directory
	terminal --> cd /

Show current directory
	terminal --> pwd

We can list subdirectories as
	terminal --> cd /usr/ + Tab

Show present working directory (pwd)
	terminal --> pwd



=========================
Section 4 13 Filtering LS
=========================

Go to home directory
	terminal --> cd

Check the current directory
	terminal --> pwd

Create files in the current directory
	terminal --> touch myfile1 myfile2 myfile3

Create files with different names
	terminal --> touch fall fell full fill

Confirm file creation
	terminal --> ls

Show information about myfile1
	terminal --> ls -l myfile1

	result: -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:21 myfile1

List all directory content and its details
	terminal --> ls -la

Filter all files starting with 'f' and ending with 'll' with the '?' operator
	terminal --> ls -l f?ll
result:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:22 fall
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:22 fell
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:22 fill
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:22 full

Filter all files contains 'my' in its name with '*' operator
	terminal --> ls -l my*
result:
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:21 myfile1
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:21 myfile2
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 11 13:21 myfile3



=======================
Section 4 14 CP command
=======================

Navigate to home directory
	terminal --> cd

Create a test file
	terminal --> touch test1

Confirm file creation
	terminal --> ls -la

Edit the file and add content
	terminal --> vi test1

test1
------------------------------------
some content
------------------------------------
save file - escape, :wq!, enter

Confirm content in the file
	termianl --> cat test1

Copy the file in different filename
	terminal --> cp <source name> <destination name>

	terminal --> cp test1 test2

Confirm creation of the second file and its content
	terminal --> cat test2

We can overwrite some file with '-i' parameter
	terminal --> cp -i test1 myfile1
confirm the overwrite
	terminal --> y

Confirm the content of myfile1
	terminal --> cat myfile1
result:
------------------------------------
some content
------------------------------------


================================
Section 4 15 Tab Auto-completion
================================

We can set autocomplete.
When we write command we can press tab and list the directory content.

We can start writing filename or directory name and press TAB to list or suggest all names containing this characters.

This can prevent typo mistakes and speed up our work.


===================================
Section 4 16 SYM AND HRD Link Files
===================================

Two types of links - Synbolic and Hard links

Symbolic Links points to the address of the content. If the source file is deleted, the simbolic file is also deleted.

Hard Link is a another copy of the source constent. If the source content is deleted the hard link content is still available.

Create soft (symbolic) link of a file
-------------------------------------
	terminal --> ln -s source_file_name soft_linked_file_name

After we list files in the current directory, we can see 'arrow' sign after the linked_file_name to the source file_name
	terminal --> ls -l

	# simbolic linked file are only pointers and do not contain the same content as the source_file so it is smaller.

Every file have unique identification number. If we look the identification number of the symbolic (soft) linked file, it is different from the one of the source file.
	
Print the indentification file of the source file
	termimnal --> ls -i *source_file_name

Print the indentification file of the soft linked file
	terminal --> ls -i *soft_linked_file_name

# The numbers are different


Create a hard linked file
-------------------------
	terminal --> ln source_file_name hard_linked_file_name

Now when we list the files in the current dicrectory we can see that hard_linked_file_name is different file and do not have 'arrow' sign pointing at the source file.

List files
	terminal --> ls -l

List details of the hard linked file
	terminal --> ls -li hard_linked_file_name

When we look over the identification numbers of a hard linked file and source file they are the same.

Show identification number of the source file
	terminal --> ls -li ^source_file_name

Show identification number of the hard linked file
	terminal --> ls -li *hard_linked_file_name

# The numbers are the same. This mean that they are the same file but with the different name. If one of the files is deleted, the address of the memomry is still ocupied. If the last hard link of this memory address is deleted, then the nenory is freed and the content is no longer available.

When we use 'cp' command to copy a file the system is making a hard copy of the source file. This commands (ln and cp) are doing the same think - hard link. 


===============================
Section 4 17 Manipulating files
===============================

Go to home directory
	terminal --> cd

mkdir - create a directory

Create few directories
	terminal --> mkdir demo_dir_1 demo_dir_2 demo_dir_3 myspecialdir

Confirm directory creation
	terminal --> ls -la

From the previous lections we have created some files. 

Copy one of the files in the demo_dir_1 directory.
	terminal --> cp fill demo_dir_1

Print the copied file in the demo_dir_1 directory
	terminal --> cat demo_dir_1/fill

We can print he 'cp' commnad manual 
	terminal --> cp man




Moving and renaming files in Linux is made with command 'mv'.
-------------------------------------------------------------

Rename fill file to renamedfile
	terminal --> mv fill renamedfile

Confirm file is renamed
	terminal --> ls -la 

Print the renamed file content
	terminal --> cat renamedfile

# the content is the same as the original fill file




Removing/Deleting files with 'rm' command.
------------------------------------------

Create randomfile
	terminal --> touch randomfile

Confirm file creation
	terminal --> ls -la

Delete the randomfile file
	terminal --> rm randomfile

Confirm file deletion
	terminal --> ls -la
