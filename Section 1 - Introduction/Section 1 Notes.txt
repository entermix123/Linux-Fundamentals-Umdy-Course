Section 1 1 Understanding Linux Commands and Pipelines
======================================================

Common Linux commands:
stdin - standart input - linux read from keyboard
stdout - standart output - linux write to the display

less myfile - print a screen full of the file content

ls -l /bin | less  - print screen full of the result of the first command - list the content of the /bin folder


===========================
Section 1 2 What is Command
===========================

Command is a executable program: ls, cd, cat, etc.

Simple command: ls -l /home


		    simple	simple
		  ___________   ____
	  	 |	     | |    |
Combined Command: ls -l /home | less
		 |		    |
 		 --------------------
		       combined

- we have 2 simple commands combined in one line


================================
Section 1 3 Pipelines Examples 1
================================

COMMAND:			DESCRIPTION:
man				Show detailed description of other command - terminal --> man ls

wc				wc myfile - give us info about myfile - number of lines, number of words and number of characters
	wc -l myfile 		print the nuber of lines in the file
	wc -c myfile 		print the number of characters in myfile
	wc -w myfile		print the number of workds in myfile


EXAMPLES
--------

We have myfile file with 5 lines 4 words and 23 characters on each line
--------------------------
line 1 with information
line 2 with information
line 3 with information
line 4 with information
line 5 with information
line 6 with information
--------------------------
terminal --> wc myfile
	result: 6 24 115 myfile		- 6 lines, 24 words, 115 characters, filename

We can use one simple command more than once in one line:
---------------------------------------------------------
terminal --> wc myfile | wc -w
	result: 4	- the second command wokrs with the result of the first command and we have 4 words (6 24 115 myfile)


head				print the content of the top number lines of the file
cut
grep
sort
unique
ls


==============================
Section 1 4 Strange LS Command
==============================

terminal --> ls 	- show the current folder content

terminal --> ls |wc -l	- this command count the lines of the content of the current directory. Even if the content is shown as one line, the result is count as separate lines.

terminal --> ls -1 	- show current folder content as each line is on a new row

terminal --> lc -C	- show the content of the current folder as one line

terminal --> ls -C | wc -l	- count the line (result: 2)


===================================================
Section 1 5 Different Linux commands used with Pipe
===================================================

terimnal --> head -n4 myfile	- print the first 4 lines from myfile

terminal --> ls /bin | head -n15	- print the first 15 lines from the content in the /bin folder

terminal --> cut -f2 myfile	- print first 2 words/columns of each line in myfile

terminal --> grep some_word myfile	- print all words in myfile that contains/match some_word in it

terminal --> grep -v some_word myfile	- print all words in myfile that NOT contains/match (exclude) some_word in ti

terminal --> sort myfile 	- print myfile in ascending order - sorted

terminal --> sort -r myfile 	- print myfile in descending order - sorted

terminal --> sort -n myfile	- print myfile content in ascending order

terminal --> sort -nr myfile	- print myfile content in descending order

terminal --> cut -f3 myfile | sort -n	- print the first 3 collumns of every line in ascending order

terminal --> cut -f3 myfile | sort -nr	- print the first 3 collumns of every line in descending order

terminal --> uniq myfile - print only unique content in myfile - print the first unique value of the sqeuence. If we have more duplicates after different values it prints them!
